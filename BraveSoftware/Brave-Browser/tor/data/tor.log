Nov 11 12:14:03.000 [notice] I learned some more directory information, but not enough to build a circuit: We have no usable consensus.
Nov 11 12:14:08.000 [notice] Bootstrapped 40%: Loading authority key certs
Nov 11 12:14:09.000 [notice] The current consensus has no exit nodes. Tor can only build internal paths, such as paths to onion services.
Nov 11 12:14:09.000 [notice] Bootstrapped 45%: Asking for relay descriptors for internal paths
Nov 11 12:14:09.000 [notice] I learned some more directory information, but not enough to build a circuit: We need more microdescriptors: we have 0/6821, and can only build 0% of likely paths. (We have 0% of guards bw, 0% of midpoint bw, and 0% of end bw (no exits in consensus, using mid) = 0% of path bw.)
Nov 11 12:14:14.000 [notice] Bootstrapped 50%: Loading relay descriptors for internal paths
Nov 11 12:14:23.000 [notice] The current consensus contains exit nodes. Tor can build exit and internal paths.
